To run the application..

As it is a React application there is a process to set up the development environment

Install Node.JS - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
This also installs NPM which is the package manager

Once Node.JS installation is complete then open the command line (or terminal) and navigate to the 
nz-tourism-analytics folder.  
Then enter the following..  
npm install
This will install the packages through NPM.

Once NPM has installed everything then run in command line the following..
npm run dev
This starts the Node local server.  It will take about 30 seconds

Then open your web browser and enter in the url..
localhost:8080

Now it should all work.
